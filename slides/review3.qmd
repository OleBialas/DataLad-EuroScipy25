# Points to Cover

- what is a bare git repository and why is it recommended
- git remotes vs git-annex *special remotes*
- what contents are actually being pushed
- file content can be distributed across multiple sources
- which 3rd party services are supported by DataLad

## Bare Git repo as push target

- bare: no worktree; contents of `.git` directly in the directory
- can be pushed to and cloned from
- when shared, pushes won't break worktree (b/c there is none)
- can be put on a server [^1]
- with git-annex on the machine, can store git+annex
- good model for Git & git-annex aware services

## Git remotes vs git-annex *special remotes*

- store and retrieve file content (not Git repo)[^2]
- `git annex initremote ...`
- built-in and external implementations
  - <https://git-annex.branchable.com/special_remotes/>

[^2]: but actually also Git repo bundles, with [git-remote-annex](https://git-annex.branchable.com/tips/storing_a_git_repository_on_any_special_remote/)

## What contents are actually being pushed

- `datalad push` acts on the contents you already got
  - ie. keys you have locally
- `git annex copy [--from=remote|--to=remote]`
  - download and upload (no magic)

## File content can be distributed across multiple sources

- recall `git annex whereis` (n copies)
- keyword: *distributed data management*
  - can have multiple special remotes
- git annex configuration:
  - [preferred content](https://git-annex.branchable.com/preferred_content/)
  - [numcopies](https://git-annex.branchable.com/git-annex-numcopies/)

## 3rd party services
